Requirements:

- Selenium 4.10.0 (or higher if works)
- An up-to-date webdriver

How to use: 

Execute from a command prompt or an IDE. Make sure to have a path to your webdriver ready (can be the directory) and if you're going
to use Firefox, have a path to the Firefox.exe file ready (Selenium can have trouble finding it. You will probably only need to do it once, if at all).
The tests don't work on Edge yet
