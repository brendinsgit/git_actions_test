Requirements:

- Selenium 4.10.0 (or higher if works)
- An up-to-date webdriver
- Google Chrome (Works for all tests)

How to use: 

1. Download
2. Open the run.py file of your desired test case in an IDE or a CMD
3. Run in IDE. In CMD navigate to the folder which has run.py in it and type "python run.py"
4. Fill out all the required inputs
5. Watch it unfold and read the results

Failed Selenium tests should be treated as a suggestion that something might be wrong. Keep in mind that even small changes to the UI can make them fail.
